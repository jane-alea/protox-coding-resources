## Protox.io Shader Development Template

This template will help you get started developing your own shaders for shader skins for **Protox.io**.

## Requirements
- Node.js

## Usage

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:5156/`

You can add your shaders to **/public/shaders**. The folder name must match your shaders name, and the file structure should mirror the `exampleShader` folder.

After adding your shader files, replace the `exampleShader` string with your own shader name in **/src/main.ts**.

## Uniforms

The game provides the following uniforms to your shader:

- `uTime`: used for time based animations
- `uResolution`: the screen resolution
- `uChannel0`: utility texture needed for some shaders

Feel free to add your own uniforms, but be aware that **we cannot guarantee they will be added to the game**. Contact us on Discord, and we can try to figure out a solution to make your shader work.
